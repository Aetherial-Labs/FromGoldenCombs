This clay is used to make a claypot hive base, and a <a href=\"handbooksearch://hive top\">hive top</a>.  After firing your claypot hive base, pick it up in a bag slot and place it in a place with plenty of flowers.<br><br><strong>Populating Your Hive</strong><br>Your next step is to find a wild hive with a standard skep.  Once you have a populated skep, simply place it in the hive base by clicking right clicking the claypot hive base with it.  Set your empty and fired hive top on top of your new hive by right-clicking, and wait.<br><br><strong>Harvesting Your Hive</strong><br>When you see a wax ring around the top of the hive, it's time to collect your harvest!  Just pick up the hive top again, set it on the ground, and clean it out with a knife.  Now take the empty hive top and put it back on the hive base. <br><br><strong>Final Comments</strong><br>Be warned, claypot hives may be reusable, but they won't swarm to new hives. You'll have to fill new skeps to make new claypot hives."
